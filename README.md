# The Polyglot Programmer 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning adventure, a journey dedicated to mastering the cornerstones of computer science: Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository serves as a living archive of my daily commitment to sharpening my problem-solving skills, one problem at a time.

## The Challenge

The philosophy behind this project is simple yet challenging:

* **One Problem a Day:** Every day, I tackle a new data structure or algorithm problem from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
* **Three Distinct Languages:** Each problem is solved in three distinct languages—**Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**—to gain diverse perspectives on the solution.
* **Comparative Learning:** The objective is not merely to find the correct answer, but to compare the unique approaches, strengths, and weaknesses of each language for the same problem.

## Repository Structure

To keep the project organized and easy to navigate, I adhere to the following folder structure:
