# The Polyglot Programmer ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal learning adventure, a journey dedicated to mastering the cornerstones of computer science: Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository serves as a living archive of my daily commitment to sharpening my problem-solving skills, one problem at a time.

## The Challenge

The philosophy behind this project is simple yet challenging:

- **One Problem a Day:** Every day, I tackle a new data structure or algorithm problem from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
- **Three Distinct Languages:** Each problem is solved in three distinct languagesâ€”**Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**â€”to gain diverse perspectives on the solution.
- **Comparative Learning:** The objective is not merely to find the correct answer, but to compare the unique approaches, strengths, and weaknesses of each language for the same problem.

## Repository Structure

To keep the project organized and easy to navigate, I adhere to the following folder structure:

```markdown
dsa-codex/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore  
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Folder structure etc. for better understanding
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 001-Two-Sum/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Explanation of Problem
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py # Python solution
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java # Java solution
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ solution.js # JavaScript solution
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 002-Reverse-String/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java

â””â”€â”€ . . . (and other days . . .)
```
